# ML_Detect_Fake_News

In an age where the world is at the palm of your hand, we're often left wondering whether the news we consume is the legit. In order to combat this issue, we can use machine learning to determine if the news we are reading is real, or "fake news".

DESCRIPTION

This project uses various Python libraries and machine learning techniques that reads from a "title" and "text" column from an Excel file to accurately train the model for fake news. Functions such as "tfidifvectorizer", "pipeline", and "KNeighbors" were utilized to produce and train the model. Machine learning techniques such as removing stopwords and non-alphanumeric characters, as well as making all characters lowercase were used to preprocess the text.


LIBRARIES

Pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, numpy.
